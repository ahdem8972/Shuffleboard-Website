# Shuffleboard-Website

This website has 3 files, one html file, one css file, and one javascript file. 

File fifteen.html is the main file, and will lead you to a website with a shuffleboard game. 

To play the game, you need to rearrange the board to end up in numerical order from top left being 1 and bottom right being the biggest number.
There is a step counter to keep track of how many clicks/tile shuffles it took to achieve the goal.
